# Healthcare Data Analytics Project
This is health care data analytics project
### Project Overview :
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to gain insights into patient demographics, healthcare costs, and service outcomes. Using Power BI, I designed an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that helps healthcare professionals make data-driven decisions.
### Data Source
The data used in this project comes from the DataCamp course on Healthcare Analytics, specifically the Hospital Inpatient Discharges for Total Hip Replacement dataset. This dataset includes detailed records of hospital discharges related to total hip replacement procedures.
#### Key Features of the Dataset:
- Patient Demographics: Age, gender, and ethnicity of patients.
- Hospital Information: Hospital ID, location, and department information.
- Procedure Details: Length of stay, discharge status, and readmission rates.
- Financial Data: Total charges and payments made by patients or insurance.
### Tools and Technologies Used:
- Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation.

- Excel for preliminary data cleaning and transformation.
### Data Cleaning and Preparation:
1. Fixed Missing Values: Filled in missing values for age, length of stay, and charges.  
2. Removed Duplicates: Deleted any duplicate records.  
3. Standardized Data: Made sure dates and categories were consistent.  
4. Handled Outliers: Removed unusually high or low values.  
5. Added New Columns: Created age groups and a cost efficiency metric.  
6. Converted Data Types: Set the correct data types for all fields.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. Patient Demographics:  
  - Analyzed the distribution of patients by age, gender, and location.  
2. Hospital Performance:
  - Evaluated the average length of stay and discharge status across departments.
3. Cost Analysis:  
  - Investigated the total charges and payments to identify patterns in hospital costs.  
4. Outcomes:
  - Examined readmission rates and their correlation with treatment costs and patient demographics.
